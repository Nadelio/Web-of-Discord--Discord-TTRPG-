# Magic System Homebrew:
- Adds `Mana` stat
    - All classes except `Wizard` have a `2` in `Mana`
    - Mana is used whenever a class uses a skill that has a skill classification of "Spell" or "Uses Mana"
    - Using a spell that drains more mana than what the player has will take away the rest of the needed mana from the player's health
    - Mana is regenerated every turn, the amount of mana generated is calculated using: `<base_mana_stat> * <level>`
    - Players start with their class's base mana and then gain more as they complete turns
    - Mana cap is calculated using: `<base_mana_stat> * <level> * 10`
    - Going over the Mana cap will cause `1 * <overflowed_mana>` every turn until the player's mana goes back under the Mana cap
- Adds `Wizard` class
